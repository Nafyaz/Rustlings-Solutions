# Rustlings-Solutions  :crab:
I am using the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) and [Aalto's Rust Course](https://fitech101.aalto.fi/programming-languages/rust/) simultaneously to learn Rust topics.
And I come to [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/) to practice relevant topics. In this repository, I keep my solutions to rustlings.

That includes this repository and help from AI as well. Take help only after you solved a problem or totally stuck with it.

Problems I struggled with:
1. Quiz 2
2. Error 3
